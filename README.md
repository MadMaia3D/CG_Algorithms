# Computer Graphics algorithms

This repository is a way to store computer graphics algorithms that I will implement over time.

I will use the Chili Framework, written in C++, which provides a window with functionality to read mouse and keyboard inputs and, most importantly, change the colors of the pixels in the window. To find the original code for the framework, visit the Planet Chili repository: https://github.com/planetchili
If you want to know more, check out the official YouTube channel "Chili Tomato Noodle".

For the algorithms, each one will be on a separate branch, each with its own readme file with more information about them, with links to learning and study materials.
